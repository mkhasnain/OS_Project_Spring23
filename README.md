## Operating Systems Project Report
## Project Name: System call for Ice-cream factory problem 
## Instructor: Sir Farooq Zaidi
## Team members: Ahmed Raza 21k-3056 || Muhammad Hasnain 21k-4714 || Khush Bakht Aliza 21k-4713

## Introduction:
A system call is a request for a service made to the operating system by application programmes; these can be either kernel system call (without kernel involvement) or user system call (with kernel intervention). Our project is focused on developing a system call that addresses the ice-cream factory problem. We have implemented an ice cream factory using the concepts of threads, semaphores, etc.

## Features:
Our system implements thread synchronization using semaphores. It also avoids race conditions. After the number of customers are specified, the program serves them ice cream and adds the amount received to the revenue.

## Technology Used:
Platform: Ubuntu

Version: 16.04

Programming Language: C

## Conclusion:
Our project, asmentioned before, is a system call that focuses on the ice cream factory problem. Race conditions will occur in the code. However, they will be dealt with efficiently through the use of thread synchronization.

## Limitation:
Our system will cater 30 customers at a time and the flavour selection will be limited.
