## Operating Systems Project Report
## Project Name: System call for Ice-cream factory problem

## Introduction:
A system call is a request for a service made to the operating system by application programmes; these can be either kernel system call (without kernel involvement) or user system call (with kernel intervention). Our project is focused on developing a system call that addresses the ice-cream factory problem. We have implemented an ice cream factory using the concepts of threads, semaphores, etc.

## Features:
Our system implements thread synchronization using semaphores. It also avoids race conditions. After the number of customers are specified, the program serves them ice cream and adds the amount received to the revenue.

## Technology Used:
Platform: Ubuntu

Version: 16.04

Programming Language: C
